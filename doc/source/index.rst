Optimization with PuLP
----------------------

PuLP is an (MI)LP modeler written in Python. PuLP provides a simple and transparent way to create and solve linear and mixed-integer programming problems in Python. PuLP can generate MPS or LP files and call solvers such as GLPK_, COIN-OR CLP/`CBC`_, CPLEX_, GUROBI_, MOSEK_, XPRESS_, CHOCO_, MIPCL_, HiGHS_, SCIP_/FSCIP_.

You can begin learning Python and PuLP
by looking at the content below. We recommend that you read The Optimisation Process,
Optimisation Concepts, and the Introduction to Python
before beginning the case-studies. For instructions for the installation of PuLP
see :ref:`installation`.

The full PuLP function documentation is available, and useful functions
will be explained in the case studies.
The case studies are in order, so the later case studies will assume you have
(at least) read the earlier case studies. However, we will provide links to any
relevant information you will need.
